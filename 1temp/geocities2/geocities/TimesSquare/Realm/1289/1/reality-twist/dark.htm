ENLIGHTED BY DARKNESS

<P>The everlasting darkness which I surround
<BR>Or does it envelop me
<BR>Speaks softly, again, the whispers of a wicked mind…
<BR>Creations spawned from the depths of consciousness…
<BR>The depths of the Abyss which is my being…
<BR>Why do I do this?
<BR>Why now ? why ever, does this happen to me
<BR>No I do not ask for them to come… the urge to express these feelings,
<BR>Produced by the ebony darkness…
<BR>The strands of wisdom which flow from the night
<BR>They which give me these wonderful illusions from which
<BR>I write.
<BR>I do not wish for it to stop.
<BR>I require just a simple answer…
<BR>Why?
<BR>Why not some other time… why this place, this time?
<BR>The feelings that wrap around me, where do they come from?
<BR>They urge me to express myself, now more than ever, creating
<BR>The fanatic addiction… addiction to illusion,
<BR>The Illusion of the Mind
<BR>Ink is light compared to this dense darkness
<BR>The same darkness that flares these feelings…
<BR>Into me, my head…. But WHY?!
<BR>Why do I do this ?
<BR>Why now ?
<BR>How have I been blessed in such a way that I may receive these
<BR>Wonderful gifts of creation?
<BR>It is time to stop, I know it, for I cannot…
<BR>It urges me to go on, create and express, explode, shatter my imagination
<BR>Into this bit of paper… The paper… which does not even exist in physical
form
<BR>The imagination… It is time to stop NOW more than ever, for I am talking
<BR>Nonsense
<BR>Or is it?
<BR>Probably… probably art ? probably not ? Stop !
<BR>The fiends will return,
<BR>Another day.
