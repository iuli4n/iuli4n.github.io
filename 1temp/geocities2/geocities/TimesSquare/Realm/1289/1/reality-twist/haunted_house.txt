THE HAUNTED HOUSE

The haunted house
Just sits there,
Like a lifeless rock
On a cloud-reaching hill:
Peaceful, innocent, like nothing happens.
But I know better:

I got there every day,
To learn - they say...
To pain - I say !

I'm small, they're more
They love to haunt me more,
And more, AND MORE, and -- Oh
They love my soul's gore

"The best" - they say it is.
This haunted place?
Above the rest?

They swear, I bear
They hit, I weep
And I can't flee,
For they force me be
Into this ghoul-made place they call...
