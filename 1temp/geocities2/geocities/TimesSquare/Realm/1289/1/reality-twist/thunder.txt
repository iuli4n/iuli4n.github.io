THUNDER

The omnious rumbling outside my window grows larger...
Thunder echoes in the crisp night air, waving in the myst outside
my window
The millions of rain drops splashing on the wet road outside, seems like a
ragin river
Overtaking everything in sight...
Lightning flares the dark room in which I write
Bright blue flashes of pure celestial light...
Then the river... calmly flows away...
The everlasting melancholy of its silent flow is once again broken by
the booms and rumbling of the clouds above my window...
Above the misty trees which only share peaks with the world...
Praying to the sky... the dark-red plane above... beyond everything and everyone
Light flares, blinds the eyes, then silence.
The cold night air visits this room once in a while
And with it comes the everlasting pain... darkness... and extasy of night.
Frozen with addiction to the night... I stare outside, into the myst...
Out through the window, way out into the trees....
Light flares... LIFE Flares, every particle of air outside exploding into
the White.. Blue light...
The rumbling of the tunder is not rumbling... but it is now a battlefield...
Explosions echo through the night... Echo... Long before they end...
Another thunder...
The questions drill into my mind again... Why... When?
Rusting outside, the river flows, its course never changed or altered... stopped...
by anything or anyone
Somehow the silence melted with the raindrops splashing creates a symphony of peace...
Some may not say so, but I for one enjoy it... ever so greatly...
The lightning has subdued... Thunder does not follow it anymore.... The myst is lifted
And the river keeps flowing.
