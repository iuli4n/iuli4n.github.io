BATTLEGROUNDS

<P>Boredom will crack my skull this night...
<BR>The devastating madness into which I sink,
<BR>Or seek
<BR>Will tear away my night, this night ? every night
<BR>Voices which not even I hear, will rip upon the reality of
<BR>Night
<BR>Waking up I will find more desperation, confusion
<BR>Madness
<BR>I will not be able to go back
<BR>Sleep anymore
<BR>No more will I be able to, for I will be
<BR>Invincible
<BR>Against the everlasting battle for rest.
<BR>I will win, against my will, but I WILL WIN.
<BR>For some dreadded reason I will not sleep
<BR>Nor will I rest
<BR>Dear old mind will once more, play tricks upon my soul
<BR>Consciounceness will sweep away, and like any other night.
<BR>I will sink back into the sweet, soft, folds...
<BR>Of Sleep
