UNNAMED [Fri Feb 09 02]

To be lost.

Floating on a fragrance...
Sunk in memories of perfection..
Slidding on a strand of hair,
         on a familiar, yet denied
face.

Running down,
on the slide of a ringer...
   an emotion-transfer tool. Weapon.
Torture, seducer.

I am cursed,
To see the beauties of the world
and be denied after a sample.

An eternity in lust,
on a seemingly lost quest
for my forgotten experiences.

To find calm in the chaos of the world
             was my gift.
To find chaos in the calm
             is my curse.

--
My artistic talent eats itself.

Emotions are lost within themselves.
Calm is overflowed by calm.

The world turns upon itself,
the gears calmly...
                   ticK!
Disturbed in the illiterate misunderstanding,
I blab on about nothing.

The fool does not wish to stop.
Somehow he wants to say something,
                    Yell!
From within his confusion,
somehow he understands something,
        calling for some eternal,
Cellestial silence.

Which seldom comes.
And when it does, he is an idiot.
    For every single time
he tries to record it,

It has quickly faded,
Again,
       in the eternal
                   emptiness.

--
Empty and lost
  (more empty than lost)
is all I feel.

  It sucks: the more you find and figure out about
the world, the more limited it seems... bounded
because you find its boundaries, rationally.

  Maybe it's good to leave some things unthought of.
  After you've touched the boundaries your only source
for excitement is within the confined space.. and if
you figure that out too, there is not much fun anywhere
else except inside your head.

  In darkness, you stumbled excitedly and find walls.
  You then map everything else out, connecting your
whole reality.
  Figured alone, in your growing insanity you descend,
and slowly... end

-?
  Each with his/her qualities.
  Confined by a limited existence..
  I think this is a problem without possible solution.
  To prove that you could live infinitely would lead to be
the conclusion, contradiction, that you would not call
yourself alive after infinity+1 years.
