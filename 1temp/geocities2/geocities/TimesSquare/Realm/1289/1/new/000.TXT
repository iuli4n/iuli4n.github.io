Following is a list of compiled entries from my diaries.
This sounds pretty gay, I'm sure, but you may find them useful.

Formats are as follows
filename: usually topic name, or if it's only a single entry, it will be 
entry_entryname
file entry: 
  usually they'll have names in CAPS; following will be a date in some format, and 
sometimes a time (pay attention to the dates)
  sometimes there will be "---" at the begining of lines, these mean passing of time, 
but still in the same entry
  you'll rarily see [], which mean that something has been omitted
