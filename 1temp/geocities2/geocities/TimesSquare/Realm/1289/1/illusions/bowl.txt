The bowl slips in between the feeble hands. A gasp echoes eternally through a stopped moment. The glass bowl starts its 
uninterrupted descent to the white marble floor. The contact with air creates a swooshing sensation upon the smooth surface of 
the dish. Moments pass... seconds, years, minutes. Time is still. The bowl hangs there, in midair. Between the still, lifeless 
hands, and the cold ground. No movement. The bowl is smooth, a rock carved from crystals. The dents of marksmanship can still 
be seen upon its surface, small dents glistening in the warm sun. The swooshing sound is captured with time. Everlasting echo. 
Then times decides to take its wrath. No time passes. The bowl falls, within an instant, to the ground barely touching, then 
times slows down to a second. But the bowl can't stop. Time cannot hold it. It touches the cold surface, and in that instant, 
half of it is cracked. Nothingness passes. The bowl is shattered, and the echo boom of its impact rings in the air. Small bits 
of matter crack off, and start their ascension into the air. Ripped away from the bowl, they slowly rotate in the crisp air. 
Light glistens off their smooth surface. Now millions of little pieces cover the bowl, some split away from the bowl. The next 
instant, the bowl explodes. The pieces rupture, fly off to be carried by the cold wind, rotating, glistening the light on 
their surface, enjoying the freedom and warmth of the sun. Soon only the large ones still rotate around the area of the crash. 
They turn in the air, like birds, doing flips, but heading for the ground. Some reach it, some get carried away. Once on the 
ground, they break into smaller pieces, and the whole process starts all over again. Light glistening on millions of pieces 
once more. The ringing of their crashing echoing through time.
