DEAD

There was this kid named after life.
Once upon a time, there was a little kid.
And now the kid is outside.

Outside in the cold.
Outside in the rain, outside in the terror.

This little kid has been sitting there for four years.
The wind has torn his clothes away.
The cold has ripped his skin.
The rain has washed his tears.

The kid is now strong.
Not still sitting, but has started to move.
Outside it's cold

A dark and crispy rain pours down in the night.
Pours down on this little kid.
But the kid endures.
He has endured it all these years...
Why not one more... maybe it will stop. Maybe it will die.
Or maybe hopefully his wish will be granted and He will die.

This kid is moving, like I said.
His hands are trembling from the tradition.
Even though he does not feel the cold, only the night.
He is moving, others see him.
Others have seen him, have helped him.
Are helping his legs move, his eyes see, his hands feel.
But his ears have more work to be done. He does not believe.
It is cold.

But the kid has no soul. It was all dried away. A long.
Long... 2 years ago.
