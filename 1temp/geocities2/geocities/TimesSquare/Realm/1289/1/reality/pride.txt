PRIDE

I thought I had it all....
Never fucking do that people !! Never ever think that you have finally reached a state of perfection
in any field.
Never.
Never take pride in yourself so much as to think yourself invincible.

You will be proved dead wrong.
Yes, however impossible it might sound, something will pop up in your life,
in that perfect field of yours, and you will be squished.
Your status will go down... your self esteem will drop.. You might never be the same.
Never take pride in yourself.

It is one of the sins.. and I do not believe in such, however I have been proven wrong.
I do not know why or how the fuck this happens, but whenever I think about something and
it is perfect in my life, no change is wanted or needed...
It must go wrong.
Anything... it has always happened, I was only too blind to admit seeing it.

Now I lay broken, my only feeling of perfection is shattered, and my life and friends
are begining to crumble from the same cause.
And I do not know how this came about, how it started or when it will end.
Maybe I have to lose everything to be punished for my mistake.. for the pride...
If it has to be that way... it shall.. nothing will change it.
It will hurt.

Do not take immense pride in what you do people... As I now realize, I have said this before...
The fall from the illusion to the reality will be greater than anything you imagine.
The contrast will hurt.

Never..
Ever.
