UnTITLED #1

What is it?
Again? Calling.
There is no pain!
The cage remains though.
I'm still trapped. I've gotten used to the pain now it seems...
Or it just stilled, again waiting for my hopes to rise
(And shatter them once more)
The pounding won't stop.
The question mark for WHY, is still deep inside my chest
I can feel it twisting once more for the fouth ? fifth year.
Once again, the answer has not been found... I'm almost there
But they keep pushing me back.
Or do I myself?
Shy once more, as forever before.
The truth is far, and I will find it.
I will kill the pain.
I will kill the pain.
the chest will close allowing no more to go out. or in
And then I will be like him.

The invincible human.
Mortal, yet God.

More is to be found. My quest is not over, but it will soon be.
The crusade will be fulfiled. The pagan me.
