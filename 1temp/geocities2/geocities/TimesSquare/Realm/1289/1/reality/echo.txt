There is noOne.

No. Zero None.
Why would he care about one in a couple of billion? why ? Why read everyone one of those billion
their thoughts ? keep track of their sins ? their good acts ? why?
WHY?
and more, HOW?

I am a rat in a cage.
A specimen in an experiment gone wrong.
As I have thought before, and I hope you have recorded...
Why continue with the experiment if the specimen knows you are out there watching over him 
controlling everything in his environment?
Why would He care?
If the specimen knows, his actions will be affected by this new information. Therefore the
experiment is rendered invalid.
Unless you go on with it, however in this case, the specimen will take the second path-
-he knows you are out there, and he will live his life to the fullest, knowing that
he is invincible.
He is invincible, is he not?
You know I just thought this.

Yes.

It's all an experiment, a sick mind placing another puny brain inside a box and locking it
controling the environment, but letting the test run.
You very well know that you are not out there.
There is noone.

Two ideas at the same time do not mix.

I will die.
