SECOND ON LIFE

Fuck this shit.
Very little things come if you just wait for them.
Not very many people care about others.

And so one must make his own path. Stand up for what you believe in,
and work to get the stuff you want. Don't wait for it to come to you,
because it doesn't.
Not many things in this wretched world come by chance.

Make you own life !
Don't wait for others to tell you what is right and wrong along with what to do.

Too many years I have waited for luck to find me,
And yet only now I figure it all out.

I hope I will have the strength to take it in my own hands.
Lead my own life, not let chance do it for me.

I will change now, for the world is dead.
LIVE
